# Effects-of-image-quality-on-deep-nueral-network-paper-code
This is an implementation of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04004 "Understanding How Image Quality Affects Deep Neural Networks".
I have used the 1% of validation data imagenet dataset and results are obtained for different blending ratios of grayscale and colored images hence changing the contrast of the image itself.
The result graph is not smooth due to computational limitations ,only 500 images were used.

## Results
